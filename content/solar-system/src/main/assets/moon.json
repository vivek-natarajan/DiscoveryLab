    "medium": "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, orbiting our planet at an average distance of 384,400 km. It's the fifth-largest moon in the solar system and the largest relative to its parent planet. The Moon formed about 4.5 billion years ago, likely from debris created when a Mars-sized object collided with Earth. The same side of the Moon always faces Earth due to tidal locking. The Moon has no atmosphere and its surface is covered with craters, mountains, and dark plains called maria (seas).",
    "long": "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest moon in the solar system. It formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago through the Giant Impact Hypothesis—a Mars-sized object called Theia collided with early Earth, and the debris coalesced to form the Moon. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, meaning the same hemisphere always faces us. This synchronous rotation takes 27.3 days, the same time it takes to orbit Earth. The Moon has no atmosphere, so its surface is exposed to extreme temperature variations, from -173°C in shadows to 127°C in sunlight. Its surface features include impact craters, mountain ranges, rilles (ancient lava channels), and maria (dark basaltic plains formed by ancient volcanic eruptions). The Moon's gravitational pull creates ocean tides on Earth and has gradually slowed Earth's rotation over billions of years. The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at about 3.8 cm per year. It's the only celestial body beyond Earth that humans have visited, with 12 astronauts walking on its surface between 1969 and 1972."

    "largestRelative": "The Moon is the largest satellite relative to its planet in the solar system (except Pluto-Charon, which some consider a binary system).",
    "perfectEclipses": "The Moon appears the same size as the Sun from Earth (about 0.5 degrees) due to a cosmic coincidence, making total solar eclipses possible. However, the Moon is moving away, so in the distant future, total solar eclipses will no longer occur.",
    "moonquakes": "The Moon experiences moonquakes—seismic activity detected by Apollo seismometers. Some are caused by meteorite impacts, others by tidal stresses from Earth.",
    "waterIce": "Despite appearing dry, the Moon has water ice in permanently shadowed craters at its poles, discovered by recent missions."
