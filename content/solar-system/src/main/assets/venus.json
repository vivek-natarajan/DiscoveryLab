    "short": "Venus is the hottest planet and the brightest object in our night sky after the Moon. It spins backwards!",
    "medium": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size to Earth, earning it the nickname 'Earth's twin.' However, Venus is a hellish world with crushing atmospheric pressure, sulfuric acid clouds, and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. It's the brightest planet in our sky and rotates backwards compared to most planets.",
    "long": "Venus is a rocky planet with a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid. The extreme greenhouse effect makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system, even hotter than Mercury. Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction to most planets - the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. One day on Venus is longer than one Venus year. The surface pressure is 92 times that of Earth, equivalent to being 900 meters underwater. Despite being called Earth's twin due to similar size, Venus is radically different in almost every other way."
