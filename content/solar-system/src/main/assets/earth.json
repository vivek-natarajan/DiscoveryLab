    "long": "Earth is a rocky planet with a unique combination of conditions that support life: liquid water, a protective atmosphere, a magnetic field, and the right temperature range. The planet has diverse ecosystems ranging from frozen poles to tropical rainforests. Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, which sustains life. The planet has active plate tectonics, which recycles its crust and helps regulate climate over geological time. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and has been home to life for at least 3.5 billion years."
