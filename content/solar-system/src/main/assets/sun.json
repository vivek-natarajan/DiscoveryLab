    "short": "The Sun is our star! It gives us light and heat and is the center of our solar system.",
    "medium": "The Sun is a medium-sized star at the center of our solar system. It's a giant ball of hot glowing gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. The Sun provides all the light and heat that makes life on Earth possible. It's so big that over a million Earths could fit inside it!",
    "long": "The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) that formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust. It contains 99.86% of the solar system's total mass and generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This energy takes thousands of years to travel from the core to the surface, then reaches Earth in just 8 minutes as light and heat. The Sun has a layered structure: core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere (visible surface), chromosphere, and corona (outer atmosphere). It rotates differentially, with the equator rotating faster than the poles. The Sun goes through an 11-year cycle of activity, with periods of more and fewer sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. In about 5 billion years, the Sun will expand into a red giant, engulfing the inner planets, before eventually becoming a white dwarf."
