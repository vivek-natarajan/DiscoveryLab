    "short": "Uranus is a blue-green ice giant that spins on its side! It's very cold and far from the Sun.",
    "medium": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in the solar system. It's an ice giant made of water, methane, and ammonia ices surrounding a rocky core. Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side—its axis is tilted 98 degrees. This gives it extreme seasons lasting 21 years each. Uranus has faint rings and at least 27 moons.",
    "long": "Uranus is an ice giant with a pale blue-green color caused by methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Unlike gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has more 'ices' (water, methane, ammonia) in its composition. The planet's most unusual feature is its extreme axial tilt of 98 degrees, meaning it essentially rolls around the Sun on its side. This may have been caused by a massive collision early in the solar system's history. Uranus has a faint ring system and at least 27 known moons, all named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The planet has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the solar system, reaching -224°C. Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope, found by William Herschel in 1781."

Together they produced the Titans, Cyclopes, and Hecatoncheires. Uranus imprisoned some of his children in Tartarus, angering Gaia.

  "interestingFacts": {
    "sidewaysPlanet": "Uranus rotates on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees, likely caused by a massive collision early in solar system history. This means its poles experience 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.",
    "firstTelescopeDiscovery": "Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope by William Herschel in 1781, doubling the known size of the solar system.",
    "coldestAtmosphere": "Despite not being the farthest planet from the Sun, Uranus has the coldest planetary atmosphere, reaching -224°C. This is because it has very little internal heat.",
    "shakespeareanMoons": "All of Uranus's 27 moons are named after characters from works by William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope, breaking from the tradition of using Greek and Roman mythology.",
    "faintRings": "Uranus has 13 known rings, discovered in 1977. They are much darker and fainter than Saturn's rings, made of dark particles.",
    "tiltedMagneticField": "Uranus's magnetic field is tilted 60 degrees from its rotation axis and offset from the planet's center, creating a very unusual magnetosphere.",
    "onlyOneVisit": "Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, making a flyby in 1986. No other missions have visited since.",
    "extremeSeasons": "Due to its extreme tilt, each season on Uranus lasts about 21 Earth years, with one pole facing the Sun continuously while the other is in darkness."
