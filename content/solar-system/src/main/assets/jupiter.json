    "short": "Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system! It's so large that all the other planets could fit inside it.",
    "medium": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the solar system. It's a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. Jupiter has a famous Great Red Spot—a giant storm bigger than Earth that has been raging for centuries. It has at least 95 moons and faint rings.",
    "long": "Jupiter is a massive gas giant with more than twice the mass of all other planets combined. Its atmosphere features colorful bands of clouds and powerful storms, including the Great Red Spot—a hurricane-like storm larger than Earth that has persisted for at least 400 years. Jupiter rotates faster than any other planet, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours, which creates its distinctive banded appearance. The planet has a powerful magnetic field, intense radiation belts, and at least 95 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo in 1610. Jupiter acts as a cosmic vacuum cleaner, protecting inner planets by capturing or deflecting asteroids and comets with its immense gravity."

    "largestPlanet": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system with more mass than all other planets combined (2.5 times).",
    "fastestRotation": "Despite its enormous size, Jupiter rotates faster than any other planet, completing one rotation in less than 10 hours. This rapid rotation causes the planet to bulge at its equator.",
    "ancientStorm": "The Great Red Spot has been continuously observed for over 400 years, though it may be much older. However, it's been shrinking in recent decades.",
    "protector": "Jupiter's massive gravity acts as a cosmic shield, deflecting or capturing asteroids and comets that might otherwise hit Earth.",
    "failedStar": "Jupiter is sometimes called a 'failed star' because it's made of the same elements as the Sun. However, it would need to be about 80 times more massive to ignite nuclear fusion.",
    "strongestMagnetosphere": "Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet, creating a magnetosphere so large it would appear larger than the full Moon if visible from Earth.",
    "galileanMoons": "Jupiter's four largest moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) were discovered by Galileo in 1610 and provided evidence that not everything orbits Earth.",
    "manyMoons": "Jupiter has at least 95 known moons, with more being discovered regularly. Many are small captured asteroids."
