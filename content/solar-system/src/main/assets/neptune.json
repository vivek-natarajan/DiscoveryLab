    "short": "Neptune is a deep blue ice giant and the farthest planet from the Sun. It has the strongest winds in the solar system!",
    "medium": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It's an ice giant similar to Uranus, made of water, methane, and ammonia ices. Neptune is famous for its deep blue color and powerful winds reaching 2,100 km/h—the fastest in the solar system. It has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most unusual.",
    "long": "Neptune is an ice giant with a vivid deep blue color caused by methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light more efficiently than Uranus's atmosphere. The planet has the most dynamic and violent weather in the solar system, with winds reaching 2,100 km/h and massive storm systems including the Great Dark Spot (similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot). Unlike Uranus, Neptune radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun, driving its active atmosphere. Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest—a captured dwarf planet that orbits backward (retrograde) and has nitrogen geysers. Neptune was the first planet discovered through mathematical prediction rather than direct observation, found in 1846 based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit."

      "origin": "Named after the god of the sea due to its deep blue color",
      "story": "Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. He was the brother of Jupiter (king of the gods) and Pluto (god of the underworld). Neptune wielded a trident and ruled over all waters. He was known for his tempestuous nature, causing storms and earthquakes when angered. Neptune was one of the most important Roman gods, especially for a maritime civilization.",

      "story": "Varuna is one of the oldest and most important Vedic deities. He is the lord of the waters—both the cosmic ocean and earthly waters. Varuna is omniscient, with a thousand eyes that see all human actions. He punishes those who violate sacred law and maintains cosmic order.",
