    "medium": "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system. It's best known for its spectacular ring system made of ice and rock particles. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant with no solid surface. It has at least 146 moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes.",
    "long": "Saturn is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core. Its most distinctive feature is its extensive ring system, which spans up to 282,000 km but is only about 10 meters thick in most places. The rings are made of countless particles ranging from tiny grains to house-sized chunks, mostly water ice. Saturn has the lowest density of any planet—it would float in water if you could find an ocean large enough. The planet has at least 146 known moons, with Titan being larger than Mercury and the only moon with a substantial atmosphere. Saturn's atmosphere features bands and storms similar to Jupiter, though less prominent. The planet's rapid rotation (10.7 hours) causes it to bulge significantly at its equator."

    "lowestDensity": "Saturn has the lowest density of any planet—only 687 kg/m³. It would float in water if you could find an ocean large enough!",
    "spectacularRings": "Saturn's rings are the most visible and extensive in the solar system, spanning 282,000 km but only about 10 meters thick. They're made mostly of water ice.",
    "hexagonStorm": "Saturn has a bizarre hexagon-shaped jet stream at its north pole, about 30,000 km across. This unique geometric pattern has persisted for decades.",
    "fastRotation": "Despite its enormous size, Saturn rotates in just 10.7 hours, causing it to bulge significantly at its equator.",
    "titanMoon": "Saturn's moon Titan is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere and has liquid methane lakes on its surface.",
    "enceladusOcean": "Saturn's moon Enceladus has water geysers erupting from its south pole, evidence of a subsurface ocean that could harbor life.",
    "disappearingRings": "Saturn's rings may be disappearing, raining down onto the planet. They could vanish in 100 million years.",
    "manyMoons": "Saturn has at least 146 known moons, the second-most in the solar system after Jupiter."
