    "short": "Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun. It's super hot during the day and freezing cold at night!",
    "medium": "Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in our solar system. It has no atmosphere to trap heat, so temperatures swing wildly from extremely hot to extremely cold. Despite being closest to the Sun, it's not the hottest planet.",
    "long": "Mercury is a small, rocky world with a heavily cratered surface resembling Earth's Moon. It has virtually no atmosphere, causing extreme temperature variations between day and night. Mercury has a large iron core that generates a weak magnetic field. The planet moves quickly in its orbit (hence its name after the swift messenger god), completing one orbit in just 88 Earth days. However, its rotation is very slow - one Mercury day lasts 176 Earth days. Mercury has ice in permanently shadowed craters at its poles despite its proximity to the Sun."

      "age": "4.6 billion years",
      "description": "Mercury formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the solar nebula. Scientists believe a massive impact may have stripped away much of Mercury's outer rocky layer, leaving behind a planet with an unusually large iron core relative to its size. This would explain why Mercury is so dense despite being so small."
    },
    "geologicalHistory": "Mercury's surface is heavily cratered, indicating it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. The planet experienced intense bombardment early in its history. As Mercury's core cooled and contracted, the planet shrank, creating long cliff-like scarps across its surface. Some volcanic activity occurred in the past, creating smooth plains between craters."
