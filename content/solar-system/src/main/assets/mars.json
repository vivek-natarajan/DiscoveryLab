    "short": "Mars is called the Red Planet because of the rusty iron in its soil. It's cold and dusty!",
    "medium": "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in our solar system. It has two small moons and is known for its red color caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.",
    "long": "Mars is a cold desert world with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. It has the largest volcano in the solar system (Olympus Mons) and a massive canyon system (Valles Marineris). Evidence suggests Mars once had liquid water on its surface and may have been warmer and wetter in the past. Today, water exists as ice at the poles and possibly as liquid brine beneath the surface. Mars experiences seasons due to its axial tilt, and massive dust storms can envelope the entire planet."

    "waterHistory": "Evidence suggests Mars once had rivers, lakes, and possibly oceans. Ancient riverbeds, deltas, and minerals that form in water have been discovered. Most of this water was lost to space or frozen underground. Today, water exists as ice at the poles and possibly as liquid brine beneath the surface."
